Katsa
A katsa is a field intelligence officer of the Mossad.[20] The word katsa is a Hebrew acronym for Hebrew: קצין איסוף, romanized: ktsin issuf, "intelligence officer", literally "gathering officer". A katsa is a case officer who runs agents to clandestinely collect intelligence.

Kidon
The kidon are Mossad's elite assassins. Recruits receive two years of training at Mossad's training facility near Herzliya.[13]

Sayanim
Sayanim (Hebrew: סייענים, lit. helpers, assistants)[21] are unpaid Jewish civilians who help Mossad out of a sense of devotion to Israel.[22] They are recruited by Mossad's field agents, katsas, to provide logistical support for Mossad operations.[13] A sayan running a rental agency, for instance, could help Mossad agents rent a car without the usual documentation.[23][24] The usage of sayanim allows the Mossad to operate with a slim budget yet conduct vast operations worldwide.[25] Sayanim can have dual citizenships but are often not Israeli citizens.[26][27]

According to Gordon Thomas, there were 4,000 sayanim in Britain and some 16,000 in the United States in 1998.[23]

Israeli students called bodlim are often used as gofers for Mossad.[28]
