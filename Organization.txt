Divisions
The organizational structure of the Mossad is officially classified. Mossad is organized into divisions, led by a director who is equivalent to a major general in the Israel Defense Forces.[12]

Tzomet: Mossad's largest division, staffed with case officers called katsas tasked with conducting espionage overseas and running agents.[13] Employees in Tzomet operate under a variety of covers, including diplomatic and unofficial. The division was led from 2006 to 2011 by Yossi Cohen[14] and from 2013 to 2019 by David Barnea, both of whom later served as Mossad directors.[15]
Caesarea: conducts special operations and houses the Kidon (Hebrew: כידון, "bayonet", "javelin" or a "spear") unit, an elite group of assassins.[16]
Keshet ("Rainbow"): electronic surveillance, break-ins, and wiretapping[12]
Human Resources[12]
A special unit called Metsada allegedly runs "small units of combatants" whose missions include "assassinations and sabotage".[17][better source needed]
Venture capital
Mossad opened a venture capital fund in June 2017,[18] to invest in high-tech startups to develop new cyber technologies.[19] The names of technology startups funded by Mossad are not published.[19]
